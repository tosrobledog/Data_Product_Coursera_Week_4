# Data_Product_Coursera_Week_4
This is the assignment of coursera 

the purpose of this shiny app is to show how can we select papers using graph theory. The app uploads a data file with the query "Marketing Word of Mouth" from Web of Science. The app uploads a graph object: nodes and links. The first tab shows the current papers of this topic and the color depends on the publication year. The second tab shows a list of the main papers: seminals, structural, and currents with the main network metrics: in degree, out degree, and betweenness.  The third one refers to the global metrics of the citation network, such as density, transitivity, diameter, and centralization. Finally, topology's tab presents the log-log distribution.
